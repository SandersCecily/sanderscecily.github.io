A public website made for me for people to look through and get a grip about me. This website 
uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and a sprinkle of Javascript. This webite holds all my projects  
and is almost a centerpiece for the work I've done whether I am satitisfied with its 
completion or not, and generally you will find I am not satisfied.

There are many adjustments to be made.
