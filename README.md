## Introduction
This website was made for people to find me. Coming to this website you will find my projects I've worked on and more about me as a person. This is supposed to be more of a showcase of myself to make an impression on people. I would like to communicate an honest view of myself as I see me and try to give the user a sense of where I want to be as well as where I've come from.

## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap
* Font Awesome 

## Improvements
Something I would like to add to this website is to populate the websites through a text file so that I dont have to continuously modify the HTML and let the Javascript dynamically handle it on load. I will probably make style changes or add a feature to change the style with the click of a button if I find a slow enough day.
