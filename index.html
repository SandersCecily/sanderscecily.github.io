                <p>
                        Hello! If you've come to read about me, then lucky for you, you're in the right place. 
                        My name is Cecily Sanders and I am a student interested in development. I word it in this 
                        ever specific manner because if I were to say web development I would be limiting myself as 
                        I also take interest in software development and frankly if I have the opportunity to know 
                        how something is made then I most definitely want to know. Currently I am attending the UPenn 
                        Coding Bootcamp (shoutout to you guys, hey!) but, I have my Associates from  Community College of Philadelphia
                         and plan on continuing my education further. I major undergrad in Computer Science 
                        and my Associates was  Information Technology and Sciences. I am a bit notorious for 
                        wanting to be a jack of all trades and trying to be as useful as possible by being knowledgable about 
                        a wide variety of subjects. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Personally I love working with people and computers! I thrive in a team collaborative enviroment but 
                        also appreciate the ability to be able to brainstorm and bring my own personality to my work. Some of 
                        those reasons are why I now work as a casino dealer but, also drive me away from the floor of the casino 
                        to the home of an office space with (hopefully) a set group of diverse individuals getting ready to 
                        work hard on any particular challenges that might arise.
